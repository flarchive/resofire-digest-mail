/**
 * Queueable job that sends a single digest email to one user.
 *
 * Lightweight by design — stores only the minimum needed to reconstruct
 * the email at send time:
 *
 *   $user      — serialized as a model ID by SerializesModels, re-hydrated
 *                with a single SELECT when the worker picks up the job
 *   $frequency — 'daily' | 'weekly' | 'monthly'
 *   $cacheKey  — Laravel cache key where buildSharedData() result lives
 *   $since     — period start timestamp so workers don't recalculate it
 *   $theme     — 'light' | 'dark' | 'auto'
 *
 * What is NOT stored in the job:
 *   - DigestContent (was 20-50KB of serialized Eloquent models per row)
 *   - The unsubscribe token (generated fresh at send time)
 *   - Shared section data (read from cache at send time)
 *
 * This keeps brfjobs payload to ~500 bytes per row instead of 20-50KB,
 * eliminates SerializesModels re-hydration queries for shared content,
 * and ensures the unread section and token are as fresh as possible at
 * the moment of sending.
